## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack 

### üß∞ Tools and technologies

The repository primarily utilizes Python. Here's a list of the key technologies used with links to their documentation:

- üêç [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/) - The primary programming language.
- üìî [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Interactive computing and report generation.
- üíª [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) - An integrated development environment.

### üìö Libraries and frameworks

With these tools we also use a lot of libraries to properly work with machine learning. Here are some libraries used in this repository:

- üß† [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/documentation.html) - For machine learning and data analysis.
- üî¢ [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/) - For numerical computations.
- üêº [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For data manipulation and analysis.
- üìä [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html) - For data visualization.
- üöÄ [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide) - An open-source machine learning framework.

------------

## üíª Work Environment

We use both Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code for coding, analysis, and report generation. Our environment includes:

- [üìì Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)
- [üêç Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- üåê Python Virtual Environment
- [üì¶ List of Dependencies](requirements.txt) - See [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for package management.


------------

## üì¶ Dependencies 

The list of dependencies can be found in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file in the repository. Please refer to [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for installing these dependencies.

------------

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.dpt-info.univ-littoral.fr/tremblay.jeremy/m1-ia-jtremblay.git
    ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment (Python 3 is assumed to be installed):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv myenv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows (using Command Prompt):

    ```bash
    myenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```

4. Install pip (if not already installed):

    ```bash
    python -m ensurepip --default-pip
    ```

5. Install the project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file located at the root of the repository:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. You can now navigate to the folder corresponding to the desired TP (e.g., TP0, TP1, TP2, etc.) within the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook files using your preferred code editor like Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook.

This will set up your local environment with the necessary dependencies and tools to run the notebooks for different TPs.
